    * Set up a system to track the status of applications (e.g., application received, under review, interview scheduled, accepted/rejected).
    * Implement a recruitment workflow to allow HR to easily update the status.

4. **HR Dashboard**
   
   * Create a dashboard to quickly visualize the status of recruitments (number of candidates per position, progress of the process, etc.).
